            <note>
                <p>The Valar (sg. Vala) were the Powers of Arda who shaped and ruled the world. They
                    lived on the Western continent of Aman.</p>
                <p>The Gods is a name wrongly given by Men to the Valar. When the first Edain newly
                    arrived in Beleriand and disputed whether or not to remain, they referred to the
                    Valar as gods in the West.They had not at this point been tutored by the Elves
                    in such high matters.</p>

                    called "Shepherds of the Trees".</p>
